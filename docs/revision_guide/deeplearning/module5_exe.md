# Exercise
 1. Replace the SEAbird dataset with Putra dataset from UPM: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HvR_sbEx5rzWjgTWkyjplUXgzsQkEgzH?usp=sharing.  
 
 2. Copy the code and dataset to your laptop, convert script to regular Python (.py) and run locally.  
 
 3. Convert the trained model to TensorFlow Lite (.tflite format)  
 
 4. Experiment with different pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet) instead of MobileNetV3 and compare their performance on the seabird classification task.  
 
 5. Implement audio data augmentation techniques(pitchshifting, timestretching, background noise addition) and measure the impact on model generalization and test accuracy.
