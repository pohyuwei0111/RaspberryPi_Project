## 🚀 Current Project: Speech-to-Text on Raspberry Pi
I’m working on building a **speech-to-text system** using Raspberry Pi 4B, a USB microphone, and the Vosk recognition model.  

### 📌 Progress Updates
- ✅ Set up Raspberry Pi OS (headless mode, VNC for remote access).  
- ✅ Configured USB microphone and tested sound input with Python.  
- ✅ Built a simple Python script to detect audio amplitude.  
- ✅ Integrated Vosk small model for basic speech-to-text.  
- 🔄 Working on continuous recording with automatic transcript saving.  
- 🔜 Next: Optimize model performance and extend to bird sound recognition.
